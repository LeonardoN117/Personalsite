  <p>so socially i have gone from butterfly to chrysalis and butterfly</p>
  <p> I say this because during online learning i had forgotten what it takes ot socialize </p>

  <p>But few extra social related things that aren't as "kapooya" on the main page are things like:</p>
  <ul> 
    <li>I tend to play soccer on the weekends with some friends and a group of other guys who we ran into about a year ago at the park my friends always played at</li>
    <li>On breaks or when downtime is available, I play games on my computer alone or with friends if they are available at the time</li>
    <li>Or I somehow end up just watching code videos that I wont try using until the future where the memory of having watched something comes back</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Music related opinions</h3>
  <p>As of right now I am simply stuck on really only listening to house related music which would include artists like</p>
  <ol>
    <b>
    <li><u>Wax Motif</u></li>
    <li><u>Chris Lorenzo</u></li>
    <li><u>Ac Slater</u></li>
    <li>Matroda</li>
    <li>FISHER</li>
    <li><u>Chris Lake</u></li>
  </b>
  </ol>
  <p>but when it comes down to what genres i listen to normally id say it would be like</p>
  <ul>
    <li>RnB</li>
    <li><i>"target music"</i><sub>working there <em>does things</em> to you</sub></li>
    <li>Rock/metal</li>
    <li>SPANISH LIKE LOS BUKIS TO LOS TIGRES DEL NORTE TYPE OF SPANISH<sup> my mom hates it when i sing these songs XD</sup></li>
  </ul>

  <h1> LET ME TELL YOU BOUT some FOOd</h1>

  <p>around fullerton theres only 2 spots i say are worth going too and that's <a href="http://www.pepesmexicanfood.com"> Pepe's </a>  </p>
  <p> and although not as good as from a few years ago but the service and ambiance is immaculate, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/veronese-gallery-cafe-fullerton-2"> Veronese Cafe </a></p>
  <p>there is also cali tacos which to me is essentially Pepe's items on steroids</p>
