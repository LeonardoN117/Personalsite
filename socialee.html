  <p>But few extra social related things that arent as "kapooya" on the mainpage are things like:</p>
  <ul> 
    <li>I tend to play soccer on the weekends with some friends and a group of other guys who we ran into about a year ago at the park my friends always played at</li>
    <li>On breaks or when downtime is avaiable, I play games on my computer alone or with friends if they are avaialbe at the time</li>
    <li>Or I somehow end up just wathcing code videos that I wont try using until the furture where the memeory of having watched somethign comes back</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Music related opionions</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Wax Motif</li>
    <li>Chris Lorenzo</li>
    <li>Ac Slater</li>
