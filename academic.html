        <h1> Academic History at CSUF</h1>
        <p>before diving into the CSUF related content, in Highschool I have 4 years of engineering principles as </p>
        <ol>
            <li>coding vex projects</li>
            <li>SolidWorks related project</li>
            <li>essentially pre-120 and 120</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So 2 years online doesn't really help much in learning </p>
        <p> so now here i am 4th year CS student finally doing something</p>
        <p> a html project here and there, some "actual code" project there</p>
        <p> and seeking internships  has become fun, guessing how long that rejection email will take to reach me</p>
        <p>And this semester i got 10 hour gaps. I <del>hate</del> <ins>LOVE THAT</ins>!</p>
        <hr>
        <h2> Immediately threw myself at an engineering frat</h2>
        <p><small>Ok i know the title be funky but let me explain</small></p>
        <p> 2 years online, 0 friends, chance to make engineering friends comes up and they actually cool</p>
        <p> how could i say no. jump to today and now im confident in most of my classes and my drive</p>
        <p>for being the best cs oriented student i can be while having a somewhat secure social life </p>
        <hr>
        <hr>
        <p>what i can say is that ive had good classes and terrible classes(prof biased) and here it is</p>

        <dt>Theta Tau</dt>
        <dd>a professional engineering fraternity</dd>
      </dl>
    <p>Ive been associated with them since spring 22' and an actual member since fall'22</p>
    <p>I've gotten good project experience in building a Battle Bot and using SolidWorks in order to 3d a new print/updated version of our wooden fraternal letters</p>
    <p> and now as a more personal/legacy project for them, I started building a resource page where alumni can present knowledge of classes and prof in order to make new members read from others first hand experiences.</p>
